geodjango-leaflet-map-filter
============================

Small <strong>GeoDjango app</strong> for filtering points (objects) on leaflet map

It provides nice and easy way for users to filter and query map objects based on their attributes.
Although all map objects here are related to model 'ApartmentsNY' it can easily be modifed and replaced with some any other model (depending on your needs).<br>
Please have in mind that this is just basic version and that it could easily be extended depending on your needs.
